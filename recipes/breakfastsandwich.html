        <p>This is hands down, the best breakfast sandwich you will ever consume. The soft and runny fried/sunny side up egg compliments the slightly charred breakfast sausage patty perfectly. You won't want to cook anything else for breakfast. Your neighbors will be begging for the recipe once they smell the aromas released from your cooking. This is the one breakfast sandwich to rule them all.</p>
        <p>Aside from the euphoric feeling you'll receive from consuming this sandwich, this recipe is quick, cheap, and requires very little cooking skill</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large, pasture raised eggs</li>
            <li>2 slices of bread of your choice. I prefer multigrain or rye</li>
            <li>1 breakfast sausage patty. For vegetarians, Simple Organics makes a fantastic veggie breakfast sausage patty.</li>
            <li>2 slices of sharp cheddar cheese. Use the sharpest you can find for that extra oomph</li>
            <1i>1 tbsp of butter</1i>
            <li>Hot sauce</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pan of your choice (cast iron is preferred), melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the sausage patty to pan and cook for 4-5 mins per side</li>
            <li>After 4-5 minutes of cooking the sausage patty, crack the two eggs into the pan and cook until the whites are solid.</li>
            <li>Flip the eggs after the whites are solid and add a slice of cheese to both eggs. Cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the bread to a toaster</li>
            <li>Once eggs and sausage are cooked and bread is toasted, assemble in the order from top to bottom - Slice of toast, egg, sausage patter, hot sauce on the patty, other egg, salt/pepper, and then the other slice of toast.</li>
        </ol>
