        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Lentil soup is a great fantastic choice for a chilly fall day 
            or a cozy winter night. It's warm, filling, and fairly cheap 
            to make. You can even use up soon to expire veggies that you've 
            been ignoring in your fridge. This is easily a one pot meal and 
            can be made fairly quickly. The lentils in this recipe pack a 
            protein punch while the vegetables provide balanced nutrition.  
        </p>

        <p>
            The key to making a delicious lentil soup in the spices.
            Particularly the cumin, paprika, and coriander. Using expired spices
            can lead to a disappointment when you sit down to enjoy that first bite.

        <h4>Things to note:</h4>

            <li>Use more water or broth for a thinner soup </li>
            <li>Shelf life of this soup is 5 days refrigerated.</li>
            <li>Freeze the soup for longer shelf life.</li>
            <li>If you like a hardier vegetable than spinach, add kale. Adjust for longer cooking times to soften the kale.</li>
        </ul>
