        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Lentil soup is a great fantastic choice for a chilly fall day 
            or a cozy winter night. It's warm, filling, and fairly cheap 
            to make. You can even use up soon to expire veggies that you've 
            been ignoring in your fridge. This is easily a one pot meal and 
            can be made fairly quickly. The lentils in this recipe pack a 
            protein punch while the vegetables provide balanced nutrition.  
        </p>

        <p>
            The key to making a delicious lentil soup in the spices.
            Particularly the cumin, paprika, and coriander. Using expired spices
            can lead to a disappointment when you sit down to enjoy that first bite.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>2 celery ribs, chopped</li>
            <li>14- ounce can crushed or diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups dry green or brown lentils</li>
            <li>7 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>3 cups baby spinach, sliced into ribbons or kale</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring frequently for about 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now add the can of tomatoes (with juices), lentils, vegetable broth, cumin, coriander and smoked paprika. Stir to incorporate everything.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and cook for about 30 minutes, until the lentils are tender and the soup has thickened. For a creamier texture, use an immersion blender to blend a few times in the pot. Alternatively, add 1-2 cups of the soup to a regular blender, blend until smooth and then return to the pot.</li>
            <li>Stir in the spinach and lemon juice. It will only take a minute for the spinach to wilt. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Things to note:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For a thinner soup, simply add more water or vegetable broth until the desired consistency is reached. </li>
            <li>Leftover soup will keep for up to 5 days in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>This soup freezes well. Either freeze in individual containers or a large container for quick future meals.</li>
            <li>May substitute kale for the spinach, but you will need to cook the kale in the soup about 10 more minutes to get it tender.</li>
        </ul>
