        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaetzle has origins in the Bavarian region, commmonly known today
            as southwest Germany, Alsace France, and northern Switzerland.
            This is primarily a noodle dish that can be served with a roast
            and steamed vegetables. Gravy or even applysauce is a common topping
            for spaetzle. It is made from flour, eggs, and water. 
            Some cultures prefer to in substitute Milk or sour cream.
        </p>

        <p>There are many styles of spaetzle, but the one we will be making
            is referred to as the "Handgeschabt" style. It consists long, non-uniform
            noodles made with a knife and a wooden cutting board
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>8 large eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 cup milk (substitute water if needed)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the flour, eggs, milk, and salt. Stir until the batter is well combined and develops bubbles. You can also use a mixer. The batter should neither be too thin nor too thick or it will be difficult to make the spaetzle with your spaetzle maker. Let the batter sit for 5-10 min.</li>
            <li>Put a colander into a bowl to drain the Spaetzle once cooked and bring a large pot of water over high heat to a boil, add about 1 Tbsp of salt to the water, and reduce temperature to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Press batter through a spaetzle maker, a large holed sieve or colander into the simmering water.</li>
            <li>Work in batches, after using about 1/3 of the batter stop adding new spaetzle and let them cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until they float to the top. Stir occasionally. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the spaetzle to the colander so that excess water can drip off.</li>
            <li>Serve the spaetzle immediately or saute them in butter to crisp them up a little. If you don't serve or saute them right away, add 1 or 2 Tbsp of butter to the hot spaetzle to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Things to consider:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This makes a big batch of Spaetzle that is perfect for a big family dinner. You can also half the recipe by adjusting the servings below the image in the recipe card.</li>
            <li>You can use milk or water to make Spaetzle. Using water is more traditional but they taste richer with milk which I prefer. You can also use a combination of water and milk.</li>
            <li>Clean used equipment with cold water, the dough is very sticky and gets stickier when using hot water.</li>
            <li>Leftover Spaetzle can be stored, tossed with some melted butter or oil, in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days. To reheat, saute them in some butter.</li>
            <li>Instead of a spaetzle maker, you can also use a colander with large holes and a silicone spatula or scraper.</li>
        </ul>
